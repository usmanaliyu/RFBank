                <p><strong>4. No advice</strong></p>
                <p>Nothing in this Website constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice, or a representation that any investment or strategy is suitable or appropriate for individual circumstances, or otherwise constitutes a personal recommendation for any specific investor. Prior to making any investment decision, the investor should fully understand the economic risks and merits and make his own determination that the investment is consistent with his particular investment needs, objectives and financial circumstances and that he is able to assume the risk. EFG recommends that investors independently assess, with a professional advisor, the specific financial as well as legal, regulatory, credit, tax and accounting risks and consequences. No information contained on or accessed from this Website should be construed as creating any contractual relationship between the providers of such information and Website users.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Research</strong></p>
                <p>Information on this Website is not a product of EFG&rsquo;s Research Department and therefore not subject to legal requirements regarding the independence of investment research.</p>
                <p><strong>6. Forward looking statements</strong></p>
                <p>This Website may contain statements that constitute &quot;forward looking statements&quot;. While these forward looking statements may represent EFG&rsquo;s judgment and future expectations, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from EFG&rsquo;s expectations. EFG is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or alter its forward looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.</p>
                <p><strong>7. Risk considerations</strong></p>
                <p>Past performance should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future performance, and no representation or warranty, expressed or implied, is made regarding future performance. Investing entails risks, including a partial or even a total loss of their invested capital. The price of, value of and income from securities or financial instruments can fall as well as rise. Certain investments are subject to high volatility, and may experience sudden and large falls in their value. Losses may equal or exceed the original investment: no assurance can be given that the investment objective of any product will be achieved or that substantial losses will not be suffered. Foreign currency-denominated securities and financial instruments are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates that may have a positive or adverse effect on the value, price or income of such securities or financial instruments. Some investments may not be readily realizable and it may not be possible to promptly sell or realize those investments and it may result in selling and realizing those investments at a much lower price. Similarly it may prove difficult to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed. There are also special risk considerations associated with international and global investing (especially emerging markets), small-company investing, single-industry funds or investment strategies, single-country or regional funds or investment strategies, or other special, aggressive or concentrated investment strategies, such as the use of leverage or derivatives. Investors in securities effectively assume these risks.</p>
                <p><strong>8. No warranty</strong></p>
                <p>EFG has exercised the utmost care in compiling the information contained in this Website.

It is also possible that EFG has previously provided, is currently providing or will in future provide services to the issuers of such investment instruments, including, for example, corporate finance or market making services.&nbsp; Furthermore, it is possible that employees or directors of EFG have previously performed, are currently performing or will in future perform certain functions on behalf of the issuers of such investment instruments, e.g. serving as director. EFG, its directors or employees could therefore have an interest in the future performance of investment instruments.</p>

Data may be lost or intercepted by unauthorized third parties during the transfer process. EFG accepts no liability for the security of data transferred via the Internet or for direct or indirect data loss.
